# Snake-game
My first ever proper game designed with python. The YouTube channel named Clear Code helped me so much with this. 
I hope you guys can give him a check. This is his channel link: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCznj32AM2r98hZfTxrRo9bQ
He makes video of teaching people how to create A LOT OF games from scratch for FREE. He also doesn't try to hide any secret
behind his code. Some of his popular videos are: creating a simple minecraft game, creating flappy bird and  snake with python,...
He's doing all of that for FREE. I can't find a lot of people like him these days. I'll be more than happy if you can give him a subscribe, 
because he is so underrated. I'm not sponsored by him or anything but honestly, he deserves more than 17k subscibers.
Thank you for your time.
